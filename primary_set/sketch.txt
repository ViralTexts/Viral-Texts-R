THE TIN SAVINGS BANK.<br/>1!Y HOIUTIO ALGKll, Jit.<br/>Charles Lyuforil was a young mechanic in<br/>good businecK. At t!ie age of twenty-six b had<br/>taken to himself a wife, Caroline Eustis, the<br/>daughter of a neighbor, who had nothing to bring<br/>Lira except her own pernonul merit.1, which were<br/>many, aud habits ot thrift, learned in an economical<br/> household under the stern teachings of<br/>necessity.<br/>It whs well, perhaps, that Charles Lynford<br/>should obtain a wife of this character, since he<br/>himself found it very difficult to save anything<br/>from his income.<br/>It was not loni before Caroline became acquainted<br/> with her husband's failing. She could not<br/>feel quite aasy in the knowledge that they were<br/>living fully up to their income, foreseeing that a<br/>time would coma when their family would grow<br/>more expensive, nnd perhaps her husband's business,<br/> now flourishing1, might become less so.<br/>Accordingly one day she purchased of a tin<br/>pedler, who came to the door, a little tin safe,<br/>such as children frequently use for a savings<br/>hank. This she placed ceuspicuoasly on the<br/>mantel piece, so that her husband might be sure<br/>to see it on entering.<br/>"Hello, Carrie, what's that?" he asked curiously.<br/>"Only a little purchase I made to-day," said<br/>- his wife.<br/>"Let me illustrate,'' said his wife playfully.<br/>Have you a ten cent piece about you ?"<br/>Charles drew a dime from his waistcoat pocket.<br/>His wife taking it from his hand dropped it into<br/>the box through tt little hole at the top of the box.<br/>Charles laughed.<br/>"So you Lave taken to hoarding, Carrie ? My<br/>little wife become a miser<br/>"No, only a little prudent. But seriously,<br/>Charley that is what I want you to do every<br/>night."<br/>"What drop a dime int this new fangled arrangement<br/> of yours r"'<br/>"Exactly."<br/>"Very well ; that will bo easy enough. A dime<br/>a day is not a great sum. But may I know what<br/>you are giug to do with this newly ctmraenced<br/>hoard r<br/>"Lay it by for a rainy day," Caroline answered.<br/>Charles laughed merily.<br/>"And what will a dime a day amount to?H he<br/>inquired.<br/>"In a year it will amount " commenoed his<br/>wife, seriously<br/>"O, never mind spare me the calculation I It<br/>sounds too much like business, and I have enough<br/>of that during the day,"<br/>"But you don't object to my plan?"<br/>"Not in the least. I have no doubt it is very<br/>commendable, but you know, Carrie, I never was<br/>gifted with much produce."<br/>"I am quito aware of that," said hit wife<br/>smiliDr.<br/>This ended tho conversation for the tine.<br/>The plan inaugurated by the young wife was<br/>steadily carried out. bho was not oue of those<br/>(of whom there are so many) who enter upon a<br/>new plan zealously but soon tire of it. In the<br/>present cuse she was thoroughly satisfied of the<br/>wisdom of her puruoso, and resolved to carry it<br/>through. Every morning she called upon her<br/>husband for a dime, which wus forthwith added<br/>t the accumulation. Frequently he had not the<br/>exact change, but would toss her a quarter instead.<br/> She would assure him laughingly that<br/>this would answer her purpose equally as well.<br/>More thau once Charles would banter her on<br/>the subject of her littlo savings bank, but this<br/>she bore gaily. But theso were, not the only accessions<br/> the fund received. Ho husband had<br/>early arranged to make all ample arrangements<br/>for dress 1 say uinj.li.', though I dare sy some<br/>of my city readers might not have considered it<br/>so ; but Caroline who was in the habit of making<br/> hes own dresses provided herself with a<br/>good wardrobe ut a muuli less expense thaa some<br/>not so well versed in the suienc managing could<br/>have done.<br/>After considerable calculation she came to the<br/>conclusion that out of her dailv allowance she<br/>should be able to make a daily deposit equal to<br/>that sh exacted of her husband. Of this, how<br/>ever, she thought it best, on the whole, not to<br/>inform Charles, wnjoying in anticipation the pros<br/>pect ot being able, at stntie tun.-, to surprise hitn<br/>with the unexpected amount ot her savings.<br/>At tho close of every month the tin box was<br/>emptied, and the contents was tt Htisferred to a<br/>savings bank of mere pretensions, wlure interest<br/>would bo allowed. When the sum deposited<br/>here became large enough, Mrs. Lvnfurd, who<br/>had considerable business capacity, withdrew<br/>them and invested in bank and other stocks,<br/>which would vield a Wire rif t cent. Of her<br/>mode of arranuemeut her hubaud reiuaiuod in<br/>complete ignorance. Nor did ho ever express<br/>any uesire to tw initae acquainted with Ins wife<br/>ZuunuL'cnient. Ho wan an east, careless fellow.<br/>spending as ho went, enieyinir the present and<br/>not feeling any particular concern about the<br/>future.<br/>At the tnd of eight years, during which he<br/>had been unusually favored ly prosperity in<br/>business and with uuiuterupted health, his books<br/>showed that he had not exceeded his Income, bnt<br/>that on tho other hand he hud saved absolutely<br/>nothing. Twenty-five cents alone stood to his<br/>credit.<br/>"Kuuniug pretty close, Carrie ?" he said lauchingly.<br/> "I take credit to myself lor keeping on<br/>the right side of the line. But then, I sappoie<br/>that you have saved up an immense tun."<br/>"How tauoh do you think?" inquired his<br/>wife.<br/>"Oh, perhaps a hundred dollars," said Charles<br/><br/>OTTAWA FREE TRADER: bATURDAl, FEBRUARY 5, 1870.<br/><br/>Lynford, carelessly, "though it wauld take a I<br/>good many diases to do that" I<br/>liu wife aisuled, but did not volunteer to enlighten<br/> kirn as to the correctness of hit son-<br/>jecture.<br/>So things went om till at length came the panii<br/>of 1857 panio so recent that it will be remembered<br/> by many readers of this sketch. It will<br/>be remembered how nniversally trade and business<br/> ef every kind were depressed at this period<br/>among others the trade which occupied Charles<br/>Lyntord suffered.<br/>One evening he came home looking quite serious<br/>an expression which seldom came ever bis<br/>cheerfnl faee.<br/>Caroline who had watched the signs of the<br/>times, was net unprepared to see this. She had<br/>expected that her husband's business would be<br/>affected.<br/>"What is the matter, Charles?" she asked<br/>cheerfully.<br/>"The matter is, that we shall have to oonomire<br/> greatly."<br/>"Anything unfavorable turned np in business<br/>matters T<br/>"I should think there had. I shall have but a<br/>half day's work for some time to come, and I am<br/>afraid that even this will fail before long. You<br/>havn't an idea, Came, how dull business of every<br/>kind has become."<br/>"I think I hare," said his wife, quietly, "I<br/>have read the papers carefully and have been<br/>looking out for something of this kind."<br/>"Do you think we can reduce our expenses<br/>one half r" asked her husband doubtfully.<br/>"I think we shall be able to do so. Both of us<br/>are well supplied with clothing, and shall not<br/>need any for a year at lesst That will eut off<br/>considerable expense; then there are a great<br/>many little suparduites you are accustomed to<br/>buy little things yon are kind enough to bring<br/>home to me frequently, which I can do very well<br/>without. Then we can live more plainly have<br/>less pies and cakes, and I have no deubt it will<br/>be an improvement so far as health is concerned."<br/>"What a calculator you are, Carrie ?" said her<br/>husband, feeling considerably easier in mind, "I<br/>really think after all you have said that it won't<br/>be so hard to live en half our usual income for<br/>the present at least. But," and his countenance<br/>again changed, "suppose my work should entirely<br/> fail I suppose yen couldn't reduce our<br/>expenses tc nothing at all, could yeu ?"<br/>"That certainly surpasses my power," said his<br/>wife, smiling, "but even in that case there is no<br/>ground for discouragement You have net forgotten<br/> our savings bank, have you ?"<br/>"Why, no, I didn't think of that," said her<br/>husband. "I suppose that would keep off starvation<br/> for a few weeks."<br/>His wife smiled.<br/>"And in those few weeks," she added, "business<br/> might revive."<br/>"To be sure," added her husband. "Well, 1<br/>guess it'll be all right I'll not trouble myself<br/>about it any longer."<br/>The apprehensions to whieh Charles Lynford<br/>had given expression proved to be enly too well<br/>founded. In less than a month from the date of<br/>the conversation just recorded, the limited supply<br/> of work which he had been able to secure<br/>entirely failed, and be feund himself without<br/>werk of any kind thrown back upon his own<br/>resources.<br/>Although he had anticipated this, it seemed<br/>unexpected when it actually came upon them.<br/>"And theworst of it is, there is no hope of<br/>better times till spring."<br/>"Do you think business will revive?" asked<br/>his wife.<br/>"It must by that time, but there are five or six<br/>months between. I don't know how we are to<br/>live during that time."<br/>"I d," said his wife, quietly.<br/>"You," exclaimed the husband in surprise.<br/>"Yes ; your income has never been much more<br/>than six or seven hundred dollars a year, and I<br/>have no doubt we can live six months on two<br/>hundred and fifty dollars.<br/>"Yes, certainly ; but where is that money to<br/>come from ? I don't want to be in debt, and if I<br/>did I shouldn't know where to borrow."<br/>"Fortunately, there is no need of it," said Mrs.<br/>Lynford. "Yon seem to forget our little savings<br/>bank."<br/>"But is it possible it ean amount to two hundred<br/> and fifty dollars r" exclaimed Charles, in<br/>surprise.<br/>"Yes, and six hundred more," said his wife.<br/>"Impossible."<br/>"Wait a minute and I will prove it"<br/>Caroline withdrew a moment, and then reappeared<br/> with several certificates of bank and railroad<br/> shares, amounting to eight hundred dollars,<br/>and a bank book in which the balance was deposited<br/> to her credit.<br/>"Are you quite sure you havn't had a legacy ?"<br/>demanded Charles in amazement. "Sure a dime<br/>a day has not prodnoed this f "<br/>"No, bnt two dimes a day have, with a little<br/>extra deposit now and then. I think, Charles,<br/>wo shall be able to ward off starvation for a<br/>time."<br/>Charles Lynford remained out of employment<br/>for somo months, bat in the spring, as he had<br/>anticipated, business revived, and he was in recept<br/> of his old inoome. More than two-thirds of<br/>the fund was still left, and henceforth Charles<br/>was no less assidious than his wife to increase it.<br/>The little tin savings bank still stands on the<br/>mantle-piece, and never fails to receive a deposit<br/>daily
